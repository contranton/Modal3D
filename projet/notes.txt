MATERIALS:
- List of pre-made materials that are only switched to and from
- Give primitives an id that allows changing material at once (upon getELementbyID?)

MENUS:
- Toggle background on/off

DRAWING:
- Show "view completed" status on menu buttons.
    - Only when profile and top are good does "generate" enable

MESH:
- Vertex smoothing
- Keep seams intact
    - Seams are where the shape extrusinos intersect
- Simulate soft body expansion?
    - Force radiated from median line
    - Getting waaaaay too complicataed
- I'm using remeshing in the blender workflow... how to do differently or simpler?
